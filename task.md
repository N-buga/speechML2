## HW:Speech recognition 1

Yout task is to implement speech recognition model using Connectionist Temporal Classification.  

The audio corpus is  available at http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/jyamagis/release/VCTK-Corpus.tar.gz

Task:
* Implement RNN-based speech recognition architeture relying mostly on spectral features
* CTC implementation by hand is mandatory

Requirements:
* You can use data only for a single speaker
* Main architecture in shoul be in PyTorch
* Use Label Error Rate for the article as metric. Y'll need it later co compare with the next homework
* All materials (source codes, description, â€¦) should be committed to github.
* Should be at leasy one jupyter notebook with results visualiztion

Deadline: 19.03.18 at 23.59
